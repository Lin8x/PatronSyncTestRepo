# PatronSyncTestRepo
This repository is dedicated to testing the Hash Studios Patron Sync System. Here, we validate the smooth integration of in-game patron ranks with data hosted on GitHub Pages. Utilize the web generator to format ranks, then sync within Unity using our Udon Prefab. Dive in and explore the future of in-game rank management!
