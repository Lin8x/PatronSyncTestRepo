# PatronSyncTestRepo

This repository is dedicated to testing the Patron Sync System. Here, we validate the smooth integration of in-game patron ranks with data hosted on GitHub Pages. Utilize the web generator to format ranks, then sync within Unity using the Udon Prefab. Dive in and explore the future of in-game rank management!

**Patron Sync System Quick Guide**

Manage your in-game patron ranks with ease! 

1. **Tags**: Define ranks with `[RankX]` for users and name them with `[RankX_Name]`.
   
2. **Hosting**: Store your rank data on GitHub Pages (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname/filename`).

3. **Unity**: Link our Udon Prefab to your hosted file for in-game rank syncing.

4. **Web Generator**: Need help formatting? Use our [web tool](https://hash-studios-llc.github.io/VRCDownloadString/index.html) to generate rank data. Just input ranks, add users, generate, copy, and host!

Manage ranks, the hassle-free way.
